The assignment is about creating a calculator, which can calculate the following three different functions at a given point:

* f(x) = 3x + 2X^2
* f(x) = (4x^3)/5 -2x

* ^, power (exponentiation). 

The program conatins a Makefile file with the following commands:
* all: Compile the program.
* maind: Creates a dynamic main file.
* mains: Creates a static main file.
* mymathd: Creates a dynamic library.
* mymaths: Creates a static library.
